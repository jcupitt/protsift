Some tools for proteomic analysis.

See the individual README.txt for details, but briefly:

COMBINE_SRFS

This program was written for the paper ELUCIDATION OF THE PATHWAYS OF 
XENOBIOTIC METABOLISM IN HUMAN SKIN AND HUMAN SKIN MODELS BY PROTEOMIC 
PROFILING. It summarises the XMEs present in a set of SRF files.

PEP_CLUSTER

This program reads a set of lists of detected peptides and outputs a
table summarising the families of proteins probably present.
